<h2>CHARIVARIA.</h2>

  <p>There are rumours of Prohibition in Scotland. We can only say that if
  Scotland goes dry it will also go South.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>By an order of the <font class="sc">Food Controller</font> rice has
  been freed from all restrictions as regards use. This drastic attempt to
  stem the prevailing craze for matrimony has not come a moment too
  soon.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We suppose it is due to pressure of business, but the Spanish Cabinet
  has not resigned this week.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p><i>The Daily Mail</i> is offering one hundred pounds for the best new
  hat for men. The cocked hat into which Mr. <font
  class="sc">Smillie</font> hopes to knock the country is, of course,
  excluded from the competition.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A horse at Chichester has been run down by a train. Asked how he came
  to catch up with the horse the driver said he just let her rip.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Despite the repeated reports of his resignation in the London papers,
  Mr. <font class="sc">Davis</font>, the American Ambassador to Britain,
  states that he does not intend to retire. This contempt for English
  newspapers will be justifiably resented.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mrs. <font class="sc">Lillian Russell</font>, of Rockland, Mass., is
  reported to have offered to sell her husband for twenty thousand pounds.
  It is a great consolation to those of us who are husbands that they are
  fetching such high prices.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The road-menders in Oxford Street who went on strike have now resumed
  work. The discovery was made by a spectator who saw one of them move.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A contemporary reports the prospect of fair weather for another three
  weeks. It looks as if Mr. <font class="sc">Smillie</font> is going to
  have a fine day for it after all.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A New York message states that the congregation of a New Jersey church
  pelted the Rev. F.S. <font class="sc">Kopfmann</font> with eggs. This is
  disgraceful with eggs at their present price.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>We have just heard of a Scotsman who has a pre-<font
  class="sc">Geddes</font> railway time-table for sale, present owner
  having no further use for it.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is stated in scientific circles that the present weather is due to
  the Gulf Stream. This relieves Mr. <font class="sc">Churchill</font> of
  considerable responsibility.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"The length of a bee's sting," says <i>Tit Bits</i>, "is only one
  thirty-second of an inch." We are grateful for this information because
  when we are being stung we are always too busy to measure for
  ourselves.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Those who maintain that nothing good ever comes from Russia have
  suffered a nasty slap in the face. A news message states that the
  Bolshevists have invited Mr. <font class="sc">Smillie</font> to visit
  Petrograd.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>"Horsehair coats have made their appearance," says <i>The
  Outfitter</i>. Surely this is nothing very new. We have often seen horses
  wearing them.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>A man who stole the same fowls twice has been charged at Grimsby. He
  pleads that his bookkeeper omitted to enter them in the day-book the
  first time.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is now being hinted in political circles that Mr. <font
  class="sc">William Brace</font>, M.P., has consented to bequeath his
  moustache to the nation.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Smillie</font> was much heartened by the news
  from Lucerne that the <font class="sc">Prime Minister</font> had climbed
  down the Rigi in three hours.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>As a result of the new rise in the price of petrol many of the
  middle-class have been compelled to turn down their automatic
  cigarette-lighters.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Although we may appear to be a little previous, we have it on good
  authority that Mr. <font class="sc">Bottomley</font> is already making
  arrangements to predict that the approaching coal-strike will end before
  Christmas.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The various attempts to swim or cycle across the Channel having proved
  unsuccessful, we hear that interest is again being revived in the
  proposed Channel Tunnel.</p>

  <p>It is rumoured that Councillor <font class="sc">Clark</font> has
  recently purchased a large consignment of Government flannel, in order to
  provide adequate underclothing for mixed bathers.</p>

  <p>A large quantity of rusty piano wire, says a news item, has been found
  in a valuable milch cow at Boston, Lines. There is hope that the "Tune
  the Cow Died of" may now be positively identified.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>According to a sporting paper there is a great shortage of referees
  this season. The offer to receive any member of this profession into the
  ranks of the Royal Irish Constabulary without further qualifications is
  no doubt responsible for fifty per cent. of the loss, whilst fair wear
  and tear probably account for the remainder.</p>

  <p>"It is high time," writes a correspondent in <i>The Daily Mail</i>,
  "that a clearly defined waist-line should be reintroduced into feminine

  the reintroduction of a waist-line elsewhere can only lead to
  confusion.</p>

<h2>A COUP FOR "THE DAILY TRAIL."</h2>

  <p>We all knew at the office that Micklebrown had gone to Cocklesea for
  his holiday. If anyone had offered him a free pass to the Italian lakes
  or any other delectable spot Micklebrown would have declined it and taken
  his third return to Cocklesea. Like Sir <font class="sc">Walter
  Raleigh</font> when he started for South America to find a gold-mine,
  Micklebrown had an object in view. He hoped to discover a topaz in
  Cocklesea. We knew the reason for this optimism. We had been shown the
  lizard-brooch, a dazzling thing of gold and precious stones, which
  Micklebrown had picked up last Bank Holiday on the cliff at Cocklesea and
  presented to his <i>fiancée</i>, Miss Twitter, after inquiry at the
  police-station had failed to discover its owner.</p>

  <p>Most people would have been satisfied to leave well alone, but
  Micklebrown is a man who hankers after the little more. The lizard's tail
  was composed of topaz stones, and from its tip one topaz was obviously
  missing. "My firm impression is that I did the damage when I trod on it,"
  Micklebrown said. "You see I put my foot right slap on the thing. I can't
  get it out of my head that that topaz stuck in the mud and it's sticking
  there to this day. Anyway I go to Cocklesea for my holiday to look. I
  know the very identical spot." He closed his eyes the better to visualize
  it. "You go up a little path behind the mixed-bathing boxes, turn sharp
  to the right at the top of the cliff, past two pine-trees and a clump of
  gorse, go a trifle inland through a lot of thistles until you come on
  three blackberry bushes; the topaz should be ten inches south-west of the
  middle one."</p>

  <p>"The colour'll be a bit washed out, won't it?" young Lister said;
  "we've had a lot of rain since Bank Holiday."</p>

  <p>Micklebrown's lip curled but he said nothing. Only to us, his
  intimates, did he confide that he had no expectation of finding the topaz
  on the surface; he expected to search through several strata of mud, and
  he was taking a magnifying-glass and a gravy-strainer with him.</p>

  <p>We heard nothing further until I had a postcard from him saying that
  the rain had caused the blackberries so to multiply that he found it
  impossible to identify the particular bush near which he had stepped on
  the lizard; he was therefore making a general search over the area. After
  that we followed the tale in <i>The Daily Trail</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Seaside Visitor's Strange Conduct</font>.</p>

  <p>Much curiosity has been aroused at Cocklesea by the behaviour of a
  visitor who spends his days on the cliff burrowing in the earth in all
  weathers. Speculation is rife as to the object of his occupation. It is
  generally concluded that he is the victim of shell-shock.</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Romantic Disclosure by Cocklesea
Cliff Burrower</font>.</p>

  <p>In conversation with our representative yesterday Mr. Micklebrown,
  whose burrowing on the cliff at Cocklesea has been observed with such
  interest, indignantly denied the imputation of shell-shock. Mr.
  Micklebrown, it appears, is spending his vacation at Cocklesea in the
  hope of recovering a topaz which formed part of a valuable piece of
  jewellery which he had the good fortune to pick up on the cliff on Bank
  Holiday. Being anxious to notify his discovery without delay to the
  police (who however failed to trace the owner) and being bound to catch
  the return steamer, Mr. Micklebrown had no opportunity to prosecute a
  search at the time. He therefore determined to visit Cocklesea again at
  the earliest opportunity to do so.</p>

  <p>In the meanwhile Miss Rosalind Twitter, Mr. Micklebrown's
  <i>fiancée</i>, is the happy possessor of the ornament. Interviewed by a
  correspondent, Miss Twitter, a winsome dark-eyed brunette in a cretonne
  chemise frock, said, "Yes, it is quite true that I sleep with it under my
  pillow. I hope Dinky (Rosalind's pet name for her lover) will find the
  topaz; he is a dear painstaking boy. I have never had such a lovely piece
  of jewellery in my life and I am going to be married in it." (Photo of
  Miss Twitter on back page. Inset (1) The brooch; (2) Mr.
  Micklebrown.)</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Search for Missing Topaz at
Cocklesea</font>.</p>

  <p>Owing to the publicity given to his story by <i>The Daily Trail</i>
  hundreds of willing hands assisted Mr. Micklebrown in his search
  yesterday. Pickaxes, shovels and wooden spades were being freely wielded
  on the cliff. Miss Twitter writes to us: "Every moment I expect a
  telegram from Dinky that the topaz is found. I can never be grateful
  enough to <i>The Daily Trail</i> for the interest it has taken in my
  brooch."</p>

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Dramatic Sequel To Search For
Cocklesea Topaz</font>.</p>

  <p>As a result of the wide circulation of <i>The Daily Trail</i> the
  brooch picked up by Mr. Micklebrown on the cliff on Bank Holiday has been
  claimed by Miss Ivy Peckaby, of Wimbledon. Miss Peckaby identified the
  brooch from the photograph which appeared in our issue of Friday.
  Conversing with our representative, Miss Peckaby, a slim, golden-haired
  girl in hand-knitted cerise jumper with cream collar and cuffs, said, "I
  jumped for joy when I recognised my darling brooch on your picture page.
  I must have lost it at Cocklesea on Bank Holiday, but I didn't miss it
  until two Sundays afterwards. I shall never forget what I owe to <i>The
  Daily Trail</i>."</p>

  <p>Questioned as to the missing topaz Miss Peckaby sighed. "It has always
  been missing," she said. "You see, Clarence" (Miss Peckaby's affianced
  husband) "bought the brooch second-hand; he is going to have another
  topaz put in when he can afford it; but topazes are so dreadfully dear."

<p class="center"><font class="sc">Free Gift of a Topaz by <i>The Daily Trail</i></font>.</p>

  <p>Yesterday Miss Ivy Peckaby was the happy recipient of a topaz at the
  hands of a representative of <i>The Daily Trail</i>. The stone, which is
  of magnificent colour and quality, is the free gift of <i>The Daily
  Trail</i>. <i>The Daily Trail</i> is also defraying the entire cost of
  setting the gem in Miss Peckaby's brooch. Photo on back page of Miss
  Peckaby acknowledging <i>The Daily Trail's</i> free gift of a topaz.

  <p>I have heard nothing further from Micklebrown.</p>

<h2>THE HUMAN CITY AND SUBURBAN.</h2>

  <p>The idea and the name for it were the invention of the ingenious
  Piggott. I am his first initiate, and with the zeal of the neophyte I am
  endeavouring to make his discovery more widely known. The game, which is
  healthy and invigorating, can be carried on in any of the remoter
  suburbs, where the train-service is not too frequent. All that is
  required is a fairly long and fairly straight piece of road, terminating
  in a railway-station, and a sufficiency of City men of suitable age and
  rotundity.</p>

  <p>The scheme is based on the Herd instinct&mdash;on the tendency of most
  creatures to follow their leader. For example, if you are walking down to
  your early train, with plenty of time to spare as you suppose, and you
  observe the man in front of you looking at his watch and suddenly
  quickening his steps, first to a smart walk, then to a brisk jog-trot, it
  is not in human nature, however you may trust your own watch, not to
  follow suit. This is precisely what Piggott led me to do one morning
  about six weeks back.</p>

  <p>When, on reaching the station ten minutes too early, I remonstrated
  with him, he apologised.</p>

  <p>"I am sorry," he said; "I didn't know you were behind me. I was really
  pace-making for 'Flyaway'&mdash;there, over there." And Piggott pointed
  to a stoutish man with iron-grey whiskers mopping his forehead and the
  inside of his hat, and looking incredulously at the booking-hall
  clock.</p>

  <p>"But that is Mr. Bludyer, senior partner in Bludyer, Spinnaway &amp;
  Jevons," I said.</p>

  <p>"It may be," replied Piggott. "But I call him Flyaway. I find it more
  convenient to have a stable-name for each of my racers." And he proceeded
  to expound his invention to me.</p>

  <p>Like so many great inventors he had stumbled upon the idea by chance
  one morning when his watch happened to be wrong; but he had developed the
  inspiration with consummate art and skill. It became his diversion, by
  means of the pantomime that had so successfully deceived me&mdash;by
  dramatically shooting out his wrist, consulting his watch, instantly
  stepping out and presently breaking into a run&mdash;to induce any
  gentleman behind him who had reached an age when the fear of missing
  trains has become an obsession to accelerate his progress.</p>

  <p>"It is amazing," he said, "how many knots you can get out of the
  veriest old tubs. This morning, for instance, Flyaway has taken only a
  little over six minutes to cover seven furlongs. That's the best I have
  got out of him so far, but I hope to do better with some of the
  others."</p>

  <p>"You keep more than one in training?" I questioned.</p>

  <p>"Several. If you like I will hand some over to you. Or, better still,"
  he added, "you might prefer to start a stable of your own. That would
  introduce an element of competition. What about it?"</p>

  <p>I accepted with alacrity. The very next day I made a start, and within
  a week I had a team of my own in training. The walk to the station, which
  formerly had been the blackest hour of the twenty-four, I now looked
  forward to with the liveliest impatience. Every morning saw me early on
  the road, ready to loiter until I found in my wake some merchant sedately
  making his way stationwards to whom I could set the pace. I always took
  care, however, not to race the same one too frequently <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg 185]</span> or at
  too regular intervals, and I take occasion to impress this caution on
  beginners.</p>

  <p>In the train on the way to the City Piggott and I would compare notes,
  carefully recording distances and times, and scoring points in my favour
  or his. It would have been better perhaps had we contented ourselves with
  this modest programme. Others will take warning from what befell. But
  with the ambition of inexperience I suggested we should race two
  competitors one against the other, and Piggott let himself be
  overpersuaded.</p>

  <p>I entered my "Speedwell," a prominent stockjobber. Handicapped by the
  frame of a <i>Falstaff</i>, he happily harbours within his girth a
  susceptibility to panic, which, when appropriately stimulated, more than
  compensates for his excess of bulk. The distance fixed was from the Green
  Man to the station, a five-furlong scamper; the start to be by mutual
  consent.</p>

  <p>Immediately on our interchange of signals I got my nominee in motion.
  This is one of Speedwell's best points: he responds instantly to the
  least sign, to the slightest touch of the spur, so to speak. Another is
  staying power. Before we had gone fifty yards I had got him into an
  ungainly amble, which he can keep up indefinitely. Though never rapid, it
  devours the ground.</p>

  <p>Piggott was not so lucky. At the last minute he substituted for the
  more reliable Flyaway his Tiny Tim, a dapper little solicitor, not more
  than sixty, who to the timorousness of the hare unites some of her speed.
  In fact, in his excess of terror he sometimes runs himself to a
  standstill before the completion of the course. He suffers, moreover,
  from short sight and in consequence is a notoriously bad starter. On the
  morning in question he failed for several minutes to observe Piggott's
  pantomime, and Speedwell had almost traversed half the distance while
  Tiny Tim still lingered in the vicinity of the starting post. Only by the
  most exaggerated gestures did Piggott get him off. Once going, however,
  he took the bit in his teeth and went like the wind. Soon I caught the
  pit-pat of his footfall approaching. I pulled Speedwell together for a
  supreme effort. But there were still two hundred yards to cover as his
  rival drew abreast. A terrific race ensued. Scared at the spectacle of
  the other's alarm, each redoubled his exertions. Neck and neck they ran.
  Could Tiny Tim last? Had he shot his bolt? Could Speedwell wear him
  down?</p>

  <p>Unfortunately the question was never settled. As they raced they
  overtook a group of business men, youngsters of forty or so, untried
  colts that had never yet been run by Piggott or me. These suddenly took
  fright and bolted. Inextricably mingled with our pair the whole lot
  stampeded like a herd of mustangs. The station approach scintillated with
  the flashing of spats as the Field breasted the rise. It was a grand
  sight, though so many fouls occurred that it was obvious the race was
  off. But things became serious when the entire crowd attempted to pass
  simultaneously through the booking-hall doors. Speedwell sprained a
  pastern and Tiny Tim sustained a severe kick on the fetlock. Both will
  require a fortnight's rest before they can be raced again.</p>

  <p>This will be a warning to us and to others too, I hope. Still, it will
  not deter us from racing in the future. Nor should it deter others, for
  the sport is a glorious one and I hope it may become universal in the
  outer suburbs. Piggott and I will be only too glad to give advice or any
  other assistance that lies in our power to those who contemplate starting
  local clubs in and around London.</p>

<h2>WEDDING PRESENTS.</h2>

  <p>All day long I had been possessed by that odd feeling that comes over
  one unaccountably at times, as of things being a little strange,
  interesting&mdash;somehow different, so that I was not at all surprised
  to find the Fairy Queen waiting for me when I entered my flat.</p>

  <p>It was a warm evening and she sat perched on the tassel of the blind,
  lightly swaying to and fro in the tiny breeze that came dancing softly
  over the house-tops.</p>

  <p>I saw her at once&mdash;one is always aware of the presence of the
  Fairy Queen.</p>

  <p>I made my very best curtsey and she acknowledged it a little
  absent-mindedly.</p>

  <p>"<i>I</i> want <i>your</i> advice this time," she said.</p>

  <p>I smiled and shook my head deprecatingly.</p>

  <p>"But how ...?" I began.</p>

  <p>"It's about Margery and Max," she continued.</p>

  <p>I was much astonished.</p>

  <p>"Margery and Max," I echoed slowly. "But surely there's no need to
  trouble about them. It's a most delightful engagement. They're blissfully
  happy. I saw Margery only yesterday ..."</p>

  <p>"Oh, the engagement's all right," said the Queen. "As a matter of fact
  it was I who really arranged that affair. Of course they think they did
  it themselves&mdash;people always do&mdash;but it would never have come
  off without me. No, the trouble is I don't know what to give them for a
  wedding present. You see I'm particularly fond of Margery; I've always
  taken a great interest in her, and I do want them to have something
  they'll really like. But it's so difficult. They have all the essential
  things already: youth, health, good fortune, love of course; and I can't
  go giving them motor-cars and grandfather clocks and unimportant things
  of that kind. Now can I?"</p>

  <p>I agreed. As it happened I was in a somewhat similar predicament
  myself, though from rather different causes.</p>

  <p>"Can't you think of <i>anything</i>?" she asked a little petulantly,
  evidently annoyed at my inadequacy. I shook my head.</p>

  <p>"I can't," I said. "But why not find out from them? It's often done.
  You might ask Margery what Max would like and then sound him about
  her."</p>

  <p>The Queen brightened up. "What a good idea!" she said. "I'll go at
  once." She's very impulsive.</p>

  <p>She was back again in half-an-hour, looking pleased and excited. Her
  cheeks were like pink rose-leaves.</p>

  <p>"It's all right about Max," she said breathlessly. "Margery says the
  only thing he wants frightfully badly is a really smashing service. He's
  rather bothered about his. So I shall order one for him at once. I'm very
  pleased; it seems such a suitable thing for a wedding present. People
  often give services, don't they? And now I'll go and find Max." And she
  was off before I could utter a sound.</p>

  <p>But this time when she returned it was evident that she had been less
  successful.</p>

  <p>"It's absurd," she said, "perfectly absurd!" She stamped her foot, and
  yet she was smiling a little. "I told him I would bestow upon Margery
  anything he could possibly think of that she lacked. That any quality of
  mind or heart, any beauty, any charm that a girl could desire, should be
  hers as a gift. I assured him that there was nothing I could not and
  would not do for her. And what do you think? He listened quite
  attentively and politely&mdash;oh, Max has nice manners&mdash;and then he
  looked me straight in the eyes and 'Thank you very much,' he said; 'it's
  most awfully kind of you. I hope you won't think me ungrateful, but I'm
  afraid I can't help you at all. There's nothing&mdash;nothing.
  Margery&mdash;well, you see, Margery's perfect.' I was so annoyed with
  him that I came away without saying another word. And now I'm no further
  than I was before as regards Margery. Mortals really are very stupid.
  It's most vexing."</p>

  <p>She paused a minute, then suddenly she looked up and flashed a smile
  at me. "All the same it was rather darling of him, wasn't it?" she
  said.</p>

  <p>I nodded. "I wonder ...," I began.</p>

  <p>"Yes?" interjected the Queen eagerly.</p>

  <p>"... I wonder whether you could give her that, just that for
  always?"</p>

  <p>"What do you mean?" said the Queen.</p>

  <p>"I mean," I said slowly, "the gift of remaining perfect for ever in
  his eyes."</p>

  <p>The Queen looked at me thoughtfully. "He'll think I'm not giving her
  anything," she objected.</p>

  <p>"Never mind," I said, "she'll know."</p>

  <p>The Queen nodded. "Yes," she said meditatively, "rather
  nice&mdash;rather nice. Thank you very much. I'll think about it.
  Good-bye." She was gone.</p>

<h2>THE MUDFORD BLIGHT</h2>.

  <p>Mary settled her shoulders against the mantel-piece, slid her hands
  into her pockets and looked down at her mother with faint apprehension in
  her eyes.</p>

  <p>"I want," she remarked, "to go to London."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Martin rustled the newspaper uneasily to an accompanying glitter
  of diamond rings. Mary's direct action slightly discomposed her, but she
  replied amiably. "Well, dear, your Aunt Laura has just asked you to
  Wimbledon for a fortnight in the Autumn."</p>

  <p>Mary did not move. "I want," she continued abstractedly, "to
  <i>live</i> in London."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Martin glanced up at her daughter as if discrediting the
  authorship of this remark. "I don't know what you are thinking of,
  child," she said tartly, "but you appear to me to be talking nonsense.
  Your father and I have no idea of leaving Mudford at present."</p>

  <p>"I want," Mary went on in the even tone of one hypnotised by a
  foregone conclusion, "to go and live with Jennifer and
  write&mdash;things."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Martin's gesture as she rose expressed as much horror as was
  consistent with majesty.</p>

  <p>"My dear Mary," she said coldly, "let me dispose of your outrageous
  suggestion before it goes any further. You appear to imagine that because
  you have been earning a couple of hundred a year in the Air Force during
  the War you are still of independent means. Allow me to remind you that
  you are not. Also that your father and I are unable and unwilling to bear
  the expenses of two establishments. Please consider the matter
  closed."</p>

  <p>She swept from the room. Mary whistled softly to herself, then she
  walked to the desk and wrote a letter.</p>

  <p>"... And that's that," she finished. "So now to business. I will send
  you some articles at the end of the week, and for goodness' sake be
  quick, because I can't stand this much longer."</p>

  <p>When she had posted it she retired to her room and was no more seen
  till dinner.</p>

  <p>They were bright articles and, like measle-spots, they appeared
  rapidly after ten days or a fortnight; unlike measles they seemed to be
  permanent. They dealt irreverently with Mudford society, draped in a thin
  veil of some alias material, and they signed themselves "Blight."</p>

  <p>"Disgraceful!" snorted Colonel Martin, throwing one crumpled newspaper
  after another into the waste-paper basket. "Ought to be publicly burned!
  As if it weren't enough to find the beastly things all over the Club,
  without being pestered with them at home, making fun of the best people
  in Mudford. Bolshevism! Fellow ought to be shot! Wish I knew who he was
  and I'd do it myself. I <i>will not</i> have another word of this
  poisonous stuff in my house. D'you hear, Gertrude?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Martin trailed into the hall in search of her sunshade.</p>

  <p>"It's so difficult," she complained <i>en route</i>, "to know what
  paper he's coming out in next and stop it in time;" and she wandered
  mournfully into the garden.</p>

  <p>"Mary," she sighed, sinking into a chair on the lawn, "have you
  noticed anything peculiar in the way people speak to us lately? Of course
  it may be only my imagination, and yet," she hesitated, "Admiral and Lady
  Rogers were quite&mdash;quite formal to me yesterday."</p>

  <p>Mary balanced her tennis racquet on her outstretched hand and laughed.
  "It's the local Blight, I suppose. You and Father are about the only
  people left who haven't been withered yet, and the others are bound to
  think there's something suspicious about you. Stupid of me&mdash;I didn't
  think of that. I'm sorry."</p>

  <p>Her mother started. "What do you mean?" she inquired sharply.</p>

  <p>Mary rose languidly. "However," she added graciously, "I will put that
  right for you next week. I have several sketches that will do."</p>

  <p>Mrs. Martin's face registered inquiry, incredulity, indignation and
  apoplexy in chronological order; then the garden gate clicked and a young
  man walked across the lawn. Mary looked down at her mother and spoke
  quietly.</p>

  <p>"I think it is time you knew that I wrote those articles. One writes
  about what one sees, and as long as I remain here I shall see
  Mudford."</p>

  <p>"Pardon me," began the young man, arriving, "but is this Colonel
  Martin's house?"</p>

  <p>Mrs. Martin made no effort to reply and Mary reassured him.</p>

  <p>"It's like this," he continued frankly. "I'm representing <i>The Daily
  Rebel</i>, and I'm awfully anxious to get certain information for my
  paper. I was speaking to Admiral Rogers just now and he told me I should
  probably get it here if I tried. He said he could only give me a guess
  himself and I had better come to headquarters. Madam," he bowed towards
  Mrs. Martin, "will you kindly tell me if you are the famous ..."</p>

  <p>Here Mary interposed. "My mother," she said serenely, "is not the
  Mudford Blight. Nor is my father."</p>

  <p>The young man wheeled on her.</p>

  <p>"Then you ...?" he queried.</p>

  <p>Mary hesitated, questioning her mother with a glance.</p>

  <p>"My daughter," replied Mrs. Martin in a strangled voice, "cannot
  possibly be the person you seek since she is not a Mudford resident. She
  lives in London and is only staying here till to-morrow&mdash;at the
  latest."</p>

  <p>Mary smiled radiantly and sent a wire later in the afternoon.</p>

<h2>MOVEMENT IN THE MONEY MARKET.</h2>

  <p><font class="sc">Dear Mr. Punch</font>,&mdash;I have been spending my
  holiday at a watering place, a place that fully deserves its epithet. My
  London daily has been my only entertainment, and towards the evening
  hours I have found myself wandering about the less familiar beats of it.
  I have become an intimate of the City Editor, and I hasten to inform you,
  Mr. Punch, that he has introduced me to a side of the Gay Life which I
  have been missing all these years. I will set out the tale of it, even at
  the risk of making your readers blush.</p>

  <p>It appears that recently a feeling spread in the Market (and that all
  these goings-on should take place in a market adds, in my view, to their
  curiousness) that a crisis had been reached in monetary restrictions and
  things might be eased a bit. Apparently there is a circle of people in
  the know, and by them it was immediately appreciated what this
  "relaxation" implied. The first overt sign of something doing was a
  "heavy demand for money," a need which I too, for all my quiet
  domesticity, have felt from time to time. No doubt the fast City set were
  filling their pockets before commencing a course of "relaxation." The
  next development was that the Market was approached from all sides with
  "applications for accommodation." I can picture the merry parties rolling
  up in their thousands, booking every available house, flat or room, and
  even paying very fancy prices for the hire of a booth for a
  house-party.</p>

  <p>It may give you some idea of the nature of their "relaxation" when I
  say that our old friend the Bank of England seems to have so far
  forgotten herself as to start making advances to the Government. My City
  Editor, who is possibly a family man, cannot bring himself to give
  details; he just states the fact, merely adding the significant comment
  that "the usual reserve of the Bank is rapidly disappearing." The effect
  of this example is appearing in the most respectable quarters. "All
  attempts are now failing," he reports, for example, "to keep the
  Fiduciary Issue within limits." Reluctantly he mentions a "considerably
  freer tendency in Discount circles."</p>

  <p>Further he records a tendency to over-indulgence in feasting. I read
  of figures (I hardly like to quote this bit) becoming "improperly
  inflated." Will you believe me when I add that a section of those
  participating in the beano, whose one fear was, apparently, that it would
  all end only too soon, actually were heard expressing the apprehension,
  to quote verbatim, "that they would deflate too rapidly." "The whole tone
  of the Market," says my City Editor, "became distinctly cheerful," and he
  pauses to comment on the one redeeming feature: "War Loan remaining
  steady, 84-15/16 middle."</p>

  <p>And thence to the shocking climax: Trade Returns were unable to
  balance properly, and Money (to be absolutely outspoken and no longer to
  mince matters) got tight.</p>

  <p>After this I was not surprised to read of "Mexican Eagles rising on
  the announcement of the new Gusher." Nor a little later to find the
  announcement, "Stock Exchange Dull." A very natural reaction.</p>

<h2>ON RUNNING DOWN TO BRIGHTON.</h2>

  <p>When I consulted people about my nasal catarrh, "There is only one
  thing to do," they said. "Run down to Brighton for a day or two."</p>

  <p>So I started running and got as far as Victoria. There I was informed
  that it was quite unnecessary to run all the way to Brighton. People
  walked to Brighton, yes; or hopped to Kent; but they never ran. The
  fastest time to Brighton by foot was about eight hours, but this was done
  without an overcoat or suit-case. Even on Saturdays they said it was
  quicker to take the train than to walk or to hop.</p>

  <p>Brighton has sometimes been called London by the Sea or the Queen of
  Watering Places, but in buying a ticket it is better to say simply
  Brighton, at the same time stating whether you wish to stay there
  indefinitely or to be repatriated at an early date. I once asked a
  booking-clerk for two sun spots of the Western coast, and he told me that
  the refreshment-room was further on. But I digress.</p>

  <p>One of the incidental difficulties in running down to Brighton is that
  the rear end of the train queue often gets mixed up with the rear end of
  the tram queue for the Surrey cricket ground, so that strangers to the
  complexities of London traffic who happen to get firmly wedged in
  sometimes find themselves landed without warning at the "Hoval" instead
  of at Hove. To avoid this accident you should keep the right shoulder
  well down and hold the shrimping-net high in the air with the left hand.
  If you do get into the train the best place is one with your back to the
  window, for, though you miss the view, after all no one else sees it
  either, and you do get something firm to lean up against. It was while I
  was travelling to Brighton in this manner that I discovered how much more
  warm this summer really is than many writers have made out.</p>

  <p>Around Brighton itself a lot of legends have crystallized, some more
  or less true, others grossly exaggerated. There is an idea, for instance,
  that all the inhabitants of this town or, at any rate, all the visitors
  who frequent it, are exceedingly smart in their dress. Almost the first
  man whom I met in Brighton was wearing plus 4 breeches and a bowler hat.
  It is possible, of course, that this is the correct costume for walking
  to Brighton in. Later on I saw a man wearing a motor mask and goggles and
  a blue-and-red bathing suit. Neither of these two styles is smart as the
  word is understood in the West End.</p>

  <p>Then there is the story that prices, especially the prices of food,
  are exceedingly high in Brighton. After all, the cost of food depends
  everywhere very much upon what you eat. I see no reason for supposing
  that the price of whelks in Brighton compares unfavourably with the price
  of whelks in other great whelk-eating centres; but the price of fruit is
  undeniably high. I saw some very large light-green grapes in a shop
  window, grown, I suppose, over blast furnaces, and when I asked what they
  cost I was considerably surprised. Being afraid, however, to go out of
  the shop without making a purchase, I eventually bought one.</p>

  <p>But these things are all by the way. It was when I reached the
  sea-front at Brighton that I made the tremendous discovery which is
  really the subject of this article. I realised the secret of Brighton's
  charm. It can be stated very simply. <i>It lies in the number of things
  one needn't do there.</i></p>

  <p>At little seaside resorts, such as Cockleham, there are a very limited
  number of things that people do, and as soon as one gets to Cockleham an
  irresistible inclination seizes one not to do them to-day. If anybody
  says it is a good day for bathing you say it is better for boating. And
  if they agree you wonder if, after all, golf.... And so you preserve your
  independence and feel rested and stave off for a little while the evil
  day. But only for a little. Very soon, for lack of alternative
  suggestions, you are bound to be dragged in and do something.</p>

  <p>But at Brighton the number of things to do is so enormous and so
  varied that you can spend days and days in not doing them. On the pier
  alone there are something like a hundred complicated automatic machines
  which you needn't work; there are fishing-rods which you needn't hire,
  and concerts to which you needn't listen. The sea is full of rowing boats
  and motor-launches which you needn't charter, and the land is full of
  motor-brakes which you needn't board. You needn't mixed-bathe nor go and
  watch the professional divers, nor the fish in the Aquarium, nor the
  people with Norman profiles arriving in motor-cars at the hugest hotels.
  You can simply sit still on the beach and discuss which of these exciting
  things you won't do first. And while you sit still on the beach you can
  throw pebbles into the sea. No one has ever thrown as many pebbles into
  the sea in his life as he wanted to, because someone keeps saying, "Well,
  you must decide;" but at Brighton you can throw more than in any seaside
  place that I know. And, now I come to think of it, I wonder that there is
  no charge for throwing pebbles into the sea at Brighton. I should have
  thought a low wall with turnstile gates and three or four shies a penny
  ... but I leave this commercial idea for the Town Council to work
  out.</p>

  <p>When I had thrown a great many pebbles into the sea I began to nerve
  myself for the struggle of returning. Over that struggle I prefer, as the
  saying is, to draw a veil. Suffice it to say that it is harder to run up
  to Brighton than it is to run down. But whilst I was running up I made a
  curious and interesting discovery. I found that the spell of Brighton had
  cured my cold. I had lost it in the soothing excitement of wondering what
  not to do next. This is the true panacea.</p>

<h2>THE END OF THE SEASON.</h2>

  <p>The letters of the alphabet were talking.</p>

  <p>"It's been a wonderful season," said S. "I 'm very proud of it."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said C; "I don't suppose so much interest was ever taken in
  cricket before. The number of people able to spend time at a match has
  been the greatest ever known."</p>

  <p>L agreed. "Even on the middle days of the week," he said, "Lord's has
  been packed."</p>

  <p>"Lord's, forsooth!" O struck in. "Lord's has been empty compared with
  the Oval. The Ovalites have lost no opportunity of watching their
  heroes."</p>

  <p>"When you say 'their heroes' you mean also mine," said H. "But they
  are not confined to the Oval. I have some at Lord's too; in fact, all
  over the country. It has been, all the best critics say, an H year." He
  ticked them off on his fingers. "For Surrey, <font
  class="sc">Hobbs</font> and <font class="sc">Hitch</font>; for Middlesex,
  <font class="sc">Hendren</font> and <font class="sc">Hearne</font>; for
  Yorkshire, <font class="sc">Hirst</font> and <font
  class="sc">Holmes</font>; for Notts, <font class="sc">Hardstaff</font>;
  for Kent, <font class="sc">Hardinge</font> and <font
  class="sc">Hubble</font>; for Worcestershire, <font
  class="sc">Howell</font>. And four of them," he added, "are going to play
  for England in Australia. It's a feather in my cap, I can tell you," H
  went on. "And I needed the encouragement too. No one is treated so badly
  as I am, especially in London, where I'm being dropped all day long or
  forced into company which I don't care about. Isn't that true?"</p>

  <p>"Not 'arf!" said C, who is a good deal of a Cockney.</p>

  <p>"There!" said H with a sigh, "I told you so."</p>

  <p>"There's no doubt that our friend the aspirate has done it this year,"
  said T; "but some of us are not downhearted. Look at all my <font
  class="sc">Tyldesleys</font>."</p>

  <p>"We're quite willing to look at them," said C, "but don't ask us to
  count them. Meanwhile what about my <font class="sc">Cook</font> in the
  same county? And good old hard-working <font class="sc">Coe</font> and
  <font class="sc">Cox</font>?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said L, "and what about Lancashire itself&mdash;almost at the
  top of the tree? And <font class="sc">Lee</font> of Middlesex? H may have
  the greatest number of heroes, but we're not to be sneezed at. And even
  his wonderful <font class="sc">Hobbs</font> couldn't win the
  championship. It rested between M and me. I'm proud to be M's next-door
  neighbour."</p>

  <p>"It's been a great season for me," said M. "I admit to being nervous
  on the second day of the last great match, but all's well now. What a
  game that was! And it's not only of Middlesex that I'm proud; if you
  glance at the batting averages you will notice <font
  class="sc">Mead</font> not a great way removed from the top; and <font
  class="sc">Makepeace</font> not far below him, and I hold <font
  class="sc">Murrell</font> in special esteem."</p>

  <p>"Yes," said R, "and if you continue to look you will find <font
  class="sc">Rhodes</font> at the head of the bowling, and <font
  class="sc">Rushby</font> and <font class="sc">Richmond</font> in
  honourable places, and the steady <font class="sc">Russell</font> with
  over two thousand runs to his name. There are also two brothers named
  <font class="sc">Relf</font>. Good heavens, the H's aren't
  everything!"</p>

  <p>"He doesn't claim, I hope," B struck in, "that <font
  class="sc">Brown</font> begins with H, or <font class="sc">Bowley</font>,
  or Bat or Ball or Bails?"</p>

  <p>"Nor," said S, "that <font class="sc">Sandham</font> and <font
  class="sc">Sutcliffe</font> and <font class="sc">Stevens</font> and <font
  class="sc">Seymour</font> and the gallant little <font
  class="sc">Strudwick</font> (who, like all wicket-keepers, is so liable
  to be overlooked) never existed? Not to mention my latest recruit, Mr.
  <font class="sc">Skeet</font>? Some letters can be too haughty
  and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Although I'm not too prominent," said F, "I've got a very dangerous
  bowler and hitter and captain in <font class="sc">Fender</font>, to say
  nothing of two <font class="sc">Freemen</font> and a '<font
  class="sc">Fairy</font>.' And during the season C.B. <font
  class="sc">Fry</font> bobbed up once to some purpose."</p>

  <p>I asked one or two of the letters to explain their silence.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Z, "cricket has never interested me. But then my range is
  very narrow."</p>

  <p>"And mine's even narrower," sighed X.</p>

  <p>"If it weren't for <font class="sc">Quaife</font>," said Q, "I should
  be in despair and play nothing but a quiet game of quoits now and
  again."</p>

  <p>"H may have that long string," said W, "but he breaks down badly here
  and there. Where's his six-foot-six left-handed bowler and bat? He hasn't
  got one. I have, though, in <font class="sc">Woolley</font>. And where's
  his master of the game, practical and theoretical, in a harlequin cap?
  The wisest captain any county ever had and the most enthusiastic and
  stimulating? In short, where is H's P.F. <font class="sc">Warner</font>,
  whom we're all so sorry to lose, but who had such a glorious farewell
  performance? Where? Ha!"</p>

  <p>"I claim a share in the Middlesex captain," said P proudly. "For is he
  not a Plum? I hate to see him go, but I shall not be fruitless; look how
  <font class="sc">Peach</font> is coming along."</p>

  <p>"And who owns the All-English Captain, I should like to know?" said
  the deep voice of D. "Not to mention a <font class="sc">Denton</font> and
  a <font class="sc">Durston</font> and a <font class="sc">Dolphin</font>
  and a <font class="sc">Dipper</font>. It is something to own a <font
  class="sc">Dean</font>; it is more to possess a <font
  class="sc">Ducat</font>."</p>

  <p>"Isn't life going to be very dull for all of you till next May?" I
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Oh, no," said A, who hitherto had not spoken. "We're going to follow
  the English team's doings in Australia. And won't it be A1 when they
  bring back the Ashes?"</p>

  <p>"Absolutely," I agreed.</p>

  "<i>ange adoré</i>," but it is all very decorous and his ultimate
  intentions are strictly respectable.</p>

  <p>You see, he was really just playing a game. Big game was his
  speciality (Africa) and this one was to be as big as an elephant. It
  consisted in the correction of a flaw which he had found in the object of
  his worship, the lovely young Widow <i>Audley,</i> who had refused in his
  very presence to receive a woman, an old friend of hers, who had
  preferred love to reputation. He, the gallant Captain, proposed to amend
  this error. By his French methods he would reduce the Widow to such a
  state of helplessness that she would consent to become his mistress. The
  fact that he happened to be a bachelor, and perfectly free to marry her,
  should not be allowed to stand in the way of his scheme. He would explain
  that the exigencies of his vocation as a hunter of big game demanded a
  greater measure of liberty than was practicable within the bonds of
  matrimony. He would be "faithful but free."</p>

  <p>In the course of a brief month (the interval between the First and
  Second Acts, for we are not permitted to see how he does it) she has
  become as putty in his hands. She consents to be his mistress, and is
  indeed so determined to adopt this informal style of union that when he
  produces a special marriage licence she is indignant at such a concession
  to the proprieties. But once again the Captain proves irresistible with
  his French methods and all ends well.</p>

    <p class="center">THE CAPTAIN "EXAMINES ARMS."</p>

    <p><i>Captain le Briquet</i> ... Mr. <font class="sc">Gerald du
    Maurier.</font></p>

    <p><i>Sir Nevil Moreton, Bart.</i> ... Mr. <font class="sc">Franklin
    Dyall.</font></p>
  </div>
  <p>Mr. <font class="sc">Gerald du Maurier</font> was the life and soul of
  the play, which would have been a dullish business without him. His
  reappearances were always hailed as a joyous relief to the prevailing
  depression. Even <i>Dean Carey</i>&mdash;most delightful in the person of
  Mr. <font class="sc">Gilbert Hare</font>&mdash;became at one time a
  gloomy Dean; and Miss <font class="sc">Lilian Braithwaite</font>, who
  played very tenderly in the part of <i>Mrs. Westonry</i> (the lady who
  had lost her reputation), could not hope to be very entertaining with her
  reminiscences of a lover whom we had never had the pleasure of
  meeting.</p>

  <p><i>Mrs. Audley</i> again (treated naturally and with a pleasant
  artlessness by Miss <font class="sc">Emily Brooke</font>) did not take
  very kindly to the conquest of her scruples and gave little suggestion of
  the rapture of surrender. Further, the authors paid a poor compliment to
  English gentlemen by providing the Captain with a dull boor for his
  rival. The contrast was a little too patent. Even so Mr. <font
  class="sc">Franklin Dyall</font> might perhaps have made the <i>rôle</i>
  of <i>Sir Nevil Moreton</i> appear a little less impossible. But, however
  good he may be in character parts or where melodrama is indicated, he
  never allowed us to mistake him for a British Baronet. The only person
  (apart from <i>le Briquet</i>) who contributed nothing to the general
  gloom was the Dean's wife, played with the most attractive grace and
  humour by Miss <font class="sc">Nina Boucicault</font>.</p>

  <p>A note of piquancy was given to Mr. <font class="sc">du
  Maurier's</font> part by his broken English. "Broken" is perhaps not
  quite the word, unless we may speak of a torrent as being broken by
  pebbles in its bed. There were momentary hesitancies, and a few easy
  French words, such as <i>pardon?</i> <i>pourquoi donc?</i> <i>c'est
  permis?</i> <i>alors</i>, were introduced to flatter the comprehension of
  the audience; but for the rest his fluency&mdash;and at all junctures,
  even the most unlikely&mdash;was simply astounding. Few people, speaking
  in their native tongue, can ever have commanded so facile an eloquence.
  What chance had a mere Englishman against him?</p>

  <p>The action of <i>The Prude's Fall</i> was supposed to take place in
  1919, but its atmosphere was clearly ante-bellum. Anyhow there was no
  sign of the alleged damage done to our moral standards by the War. But
  nobody will quarrel on that ground with Mr. <font
  class="sc">Besier</font> and Miss <font class="sc">Edginton</font>, the
  clever authors of this very interesting play. And if we have to be taught
  how to behave by a Frenchman, to the detriment of our British <i>amour
  propre</i>, there is nobody who can do it so nicely and painlessly as Mr.
  <font class="sc">du Maurier</font>.</p>

<p class="center">"<font class="sc">Wedding Bells.</font>"</p>

  <p>I begin to suspect that the possible situations of marital farce are
  becoming exhausted. Certainly we have lost the power of being staggered
  by the emergence of an old wife out of the past. But Mr. <font
  class="sc">Salisbury Field</font>, who wrote <i>Wedding Bells</i> for
  America, is not content with a single repetition of this ancient device;
  he must needs give us these intrusions in triplicate, showing how they
  affect the career of (1) the hero, (2) his man-servant, (3) a
  poet-friend. True he only produces two old wives; but one of them, being
  a bigamist, was able to intrude "in two places" (as the auctioneers
  say).</p>

  <p>The wife of <i>Reginald Carter</i> (Mr. <font class="sc">Owen
  Nares</font>), having first run right away from him and then apparently
  divorced him for desertion (I told you the play was American), turns up
  on the eve of his marriage to another. He has barely recovered from his
  failure to keep his future wife in ignorance of his past when he has to
  start taxing his brains all over again in order to keep his past wife in
  ignorance of his future.</p>

  <p>The First Act went well enough and was full of good words&mdash;not
  very subtle perhaps, but the kind that invites intelligent laughter.
  Later the play degenerated into something too improbable for comedy and
  not boisterous enough for pure farce. The two most disintegrating
  elements were furnished by a love-sick poet (a figure that should have
  been <i>vieux jeu</i> in the last century) and an English maid who could
  never have existed outside the imagination of an American. I make no
  complaint of the fact that in a chequered past she had married both
  <i>Carter's</i> man-servant and the antiquated poet; but I do complain
  that her Cockney accent was imperfectly consistent both with her rustic
  origin an apple-cheeked lass, we were told, from somewhere in Kent) and
  her situation as maid to a very smart American.</p>

  <p>You will naturally ask what Mr. <font class="sc">Owen Nares</font> was
  doing in this galley; and I cannot tell you. I can only say that he was
  very brave about it all. In <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"
  id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span> a sense it was a serious performance,
  the only one of its kind in the play; yet not serious enough to serve as
  a foil for the general frivolity, for he was constantly bringing his own
  high sentiments into ridicule, and so burlesquing the <font
  class="sc">Owen Nares</font> that we love to take seriously.</p>

  <p>On the other hand, Miss <font class="sc">Gladys Cooper</font>, as
  <i>Rosalie</i>, his late wife, was untroubled by high sentiment; she was
  content to be wayward and unseizable, confident in the obvious power of
  her charm to retrieve him from the very altar-rails. Her own heart never
  seemed to come into the question, and her motive in setting herself to
  recover him was not much clearer than her reason for deserting him.</p>

  <p>Some of the minor characters gave good entertainment. There was a dude
  (is that what they call them now in America?) who dressed very perfectly
  and said a great many funny things all well within the range of his own,
  and our, intelligence. Mr. <font class="sc">Deverell</font> played the
  part with admirable restraint. And we could ill have spared the humours
  of <i>Carter's</i> man <i>Jackson</i> (Mr. <font class="sc">Will
  West</font>), whose wide experience in matrimony, resulting in an
  attitude alternately timorous and prehensile towards female society in
  the servants' hall, was the source of many poignant generalisations. Miss
  <font class="sc">Edith Evans</font>, as a mother-in-law <i>manquée</i>,
  showed a touch of real artistry; and Mr. <font class="sc">George
  Carr</font> had no difficulty in getting fun out of the part of a
  Japanese house-boy, almost the only novelty which we owed to the American
  origin of the play.</p>

  <p>When <i>Carter</i> was turned down by a clergyman who refused to
  perform the marriage rites for a divorced man, there was something very
  attractive (to a golfer) in his protest against these "local rules." This
  was one of many good things said; but the play had its dull times too,
  and there were one or two lapses made in the pursuit of the easy laugh.
  For instance:&mdash;</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p><i>Carter.</i> "Do you believe in God?"</p>

  <p><i>Wills.</i> "Good God!" (laughter).</p>

  <p>[Carter <i>here kneels down to get something from under the
  sofa.</i></p>

  <p><i>Wills.</i> "Are you going to pray?" (laughter).</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p>Personality, of course, counts for much, and both Miss <font
  class="sc">Gladys Cooper</font> and Mr. <font class="sc">Owen
  Nares</font> have enough admirers to ensure a success for this rather
  moderate farce. But not a triumph, I fear; for, after all, the play
  counts for something too and, though all the Faithful may be trusted to
  put in one appearance, I doubt if many outside the ranks of the Very
  Faithful will turn again at the sound of these <i>Wedding Bells</i>.</p>

<h3>THE BRITISH TARPON.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>By our Piscatorial Expert.</i></p>

  <p>I have read with great interest, tempered by a little disappointment,
  the article of Mr. F.A. <font class="sc">Mitchell-Hedges</font> on "Big
  Game Fishing in British Waters," in <i>The Daily Mail</i> of September
  1st. He tells us of his experiences in catching the "tope," a
  little-known fish of the shark genus which may be caught this month at
  such places as Herne Bay, Deal, Margate, Ramsgate, Brighton and
  Bournemouth, where he has captured specimens measuring 7½ feet long
  within two hundred-and-fifty yards of the shore.</p>

  <p>Personally I have a great respect for the tope and for the topiary
  art, but I cannot help regretting that Mr. <font
  class="sc">Mitchell-Hedges</font> has omitted all mention of another
  splendid fish, the stoot, which visits our shores every year in the late
  summer and may be caught at places as widely distant as Barmouth and
  Great Yarmouth, Porthcawl and Kylescue.</p>

  <p>The stoot, be it noted, is a cross between the porpoise and the
  cuttle-fish; hence its local name of the porputtle. It is a clean feeder,
  a great fighter and a great delicacy, tasting rather like a mixture of
  the pilchard, the anchovy and the Bombay duck.</p>

  <p>For tackle I recommend a strong greenheart bamboo pole, like those
  used in pole-jumping, about eighteen feet in length, and about three
  hundred yards of wire hawser, with a Strathspey foursome reel
  sufficiently large to hold it. Do not be afraid of the size of the hook.
  The stoot-fisher cannot afford to take any risks. I do not wish to
  dogmatise, but it must be big enough to cover the bait. And the stoot is
  extremely voracious. Almost anything will do for bait, if one remembers,
  as I have said above, that the stoot is a clean feeder. At different
  times I have tried a large square of corridor soap, a simulation pancake,
  three pounds of tough beefsteak or American bacon, or a volume of Sir
  <font class="sc">Henry Howorth's</font> <i>History of the Mongols</i>,
  and never without satisfactory results.</p>

  <p>On arriving at the feeding ground of the stoot, cast your line well
  out from the boat with a small howitzer. You wait anxiously for the first
  bite; suddenly the hawser runs taut and there is a scream from the reel.
  But do not be afraid of the reel screaming. In the circumstances it is a
  very good sign. Plant the butt of your rod or pole firmly in the socket
  fitted for the purpose in all motor-stooter boats and let the fish run
  for about a parasang, and then strike and strike hard. The battle is now
  begun. Be prepared for a series of tremendous rushes. You will see the
  stoot's huge bulk dash out of the water; you will hear his voice, which
  resembles that of the gorilla. This may go on for a long time: if the
  stoot be full-grown it will take you quite an hour to bring him alongside
  the boat. Then comes the problem of how to get him in&mdash;the hardest
  of all. The gaff, if possible a good French <i>gaffe</i>, is
  indispensable, but the kilbin, a marine life-preserver resembling a heavy
  niblick, is a handy weapon at this stage of the conflict. Strike the fish
  on the head repeatedly&mdash;but never on the tail&mdash;until he is
  paralysed and then grasp him firmly by the metatarsal fin or, failing
  that, by the medulla oblongata, but keep your hands away from his mouth.
  The teeth of the stoot are terribly sharp and pyorrh&#339;a is not
  unknown in this species.</p>

  <p>Having got the fish on board you will need a spell of rest. An hour's
  battle with a stoot is the most sudorific experience that I know, even
  more so than my contests with red snappers at Mazatlan, in Mexico, or
  bat-fish off the coasts of Florida. A complete change is necessary.</p>

  <p>I have already spoken of the eating qualities of the stoot, which
  exceed those of the tope. One is enough to provide sustenance for a small
  country congregation. Cooked <i>en casserole</i>, or filleted, or grilled
  and stuffed with Carlsbad plums, it is delicious.</p>

  <p>And lastly it lends itself admirably to curing or preserving. Bottled
  stoot is in its way as nutritious as Guinness's.</p>

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>By Mr. Punch's Staff of Learned Clerks</i>.)</p>

  <p>Miss <font class="sc">Sheila Kaye-Smith</font> continues to be the
  chronicler and brief abstractor of Sussex country life. Her latest story,
  <i>Green Apple Harvest</i> (<font class="sc">Cassell</font>), may lack
  the brilliant focus of <i>Tamarisk Town</i>, but it is more genuine and
  of the soil. There indeed you have the dominant quality of this tale of
  three farming brothers. Never was a book more redolent of earth; hardly
  (and I mean this as a compliment) will you close it without an
  instinctive impulse to wipe your boots. The brothers are <i>Jim</i>, the
  eldest, hereditary master of the great farm of Bodingmares; <i>Clem</i>,
  the youngest, living contentedly in the position of his brother's
  labourer; and <i>Bob</i>, the central character, whose dark and changing
  fortunes make the matter of the book, as his final crop of tragedy gives
  to it the at first puzzling title. There is too much variety of incident
  in <i>Bob's</i> uneasy life for me to follow it in detail. The tale is
  sad&mdash;such a harvesting of green apples gives little excuse for
  festival&mdash;but at each turn, in his devouring and fatal love for the
  gipsy, <i>Hannah</i>, in his abandonment by her, and most of all in his
  breaking adventures of the soul, now saved, now damned, he remains a
  tragically moving figure. Miss <font class="sc">Kaye-Smith</font>, in
  short, has written a novel that lacks the sunshine of its predecessors,
  but shows a notable gathering of strength.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Would you not have thought that at this date motor-cars had definitely
  joined umbrellas and mothers-in-law as themes in which no further humour
  was to be found? Yet here is Miss <font class="sc">Jessie Champion</font>
  writing a whole book, <i>The Ramshackle Adventure</i> (<font
  class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</font>), all about the comical vagaries
  of a cheap car&mdash;a history that, while it has inevitably its dull
  moments, has many more that are both amusing and full of a kind of charm
  that the funny-book too often conspicuously lacks. I think this must be
  because almost all the characters are such human and kindly folk, not the
  lay figures of galvanic farce that one had only too much reason to
  expect. For example, the owner of the car is a curate, whose wife is
  supposed to relate the story, and <i>George</i> has to drive the Bishop
  in his unreliable machine. Naturally one anticipates (a little drearily)
  upsets and ditches and episcopal fury, instead of which&mdash;well, I
  think I won't tell you what happens instead, but it is something at once
  far more probable and pleasant. I must not forget to mention that the
  cast also includes a pair of engaging lovers whom eventually the agency
  of the car unites. Indeed, to pass over the lady would display on my part
  the blackest ingratitude, since among her many attractive peculiarities
  it is expressly mentioned that she (be still, O leaping heart!) reads the
  letter-press in <i>Punch</i>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>Mrs. <font class="sc">Edith Mary Moore</font> has devoted her great
  abilities to proving in <i>The Blind Marksman</i> (<font
  class="sc">Hodder and Stoughton</font>) how shockingly bad the little
  god's shooting became towards the end of last century. She proves it by
  the frustrated hopes of <i>Jane</i>, her heroine, who in utter ignorance
  of life marries a man whose pedestrian attitude of mind is quite unfitted
  to keep pace with her own passionate and eager hurry of idealism. She
  becomes household drudge to a master who cannot even talk the language
  which she speaks naturally, and discovers in a man she has known all her
  life the lover she should have married, only to lose <span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page200" id="page200"></a>[pg 200]</span> him in
  the European War. Here you have both <i>Jane</i> and the ineffective
  husband&mdash;for whom I was sincerely sorry, because he asked so very
  little of life and didn't even get that&mdash;badly left, and the case
  against Cupid looks black. Mrs. <font class="sc">Moore</font> does what
  she can for him by blaming our Victorian ancestors and their habits of
  mind; but I think it is only fair to add that, delightful as <i>Jane</i>
  is, she was not made for happiness any more than the people who enjoy
  poor health have it in them to be robust, and that, true as much of the
  author's criticism is, she has not been able to give <i>The Blind
  Marksman</i>, for his future improvement, any very helpful ideas as to
  how he is to shoot.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The Devil, in so far as I have met him in fiction, has usually been a
  highly successful intriguer on behalf of anyone prepared to make the
  necessary bargain. Sir <font class="sc">Ronald Ross</font>, however, to
  judge from the rather confused mediæval happenings in the Alps which are
  faithfully described in <i>The Revels of Orsera</i> (<font
  class="sc">Murray</font>), has rather a low opinion of the intelligence
  of Mephistopheles. Anyhow, a certain <i>Zozimo</i>, deformed in body but
  of great romantic sensibility, appears to have exchanged his outward
  presence for that of a rich and handsome young Count, and in this guise
  wooed the <i>Lady Lelita,</i> for whose sake her father had devised a
  magnificent contest of suitors at Andermatt in the year 1495. After a
  great deal of preliminary bungling the supposititious Count, with the
  Devil in <i>Zozimo's</i> shape as his body-servant, was just about to
  secure the object of his affections when <i>Zozimo</i> was stabbed by his
  mother, with the result that the double identity was fused and the
  <i>Lady Lelita</i> was left with a dying dwarf as her knight. If the plot
  of <i>The Revels of Orsera</i> is a little unsatisfying the elaboration
  of scenic description and mediæval pageantry is conscientious in the
  extreme, and the laughter which followed the malicious pranks of
  <i>Gangogo</i>, the professional jester of the tourney, must, if <i>I</i>
  am to take the author's word for it, have made the glaciers ring. There
  is a great deal in the way of philosophy and psychology that is very
  baffling in this book, but of one thing I feel certain, and that is that
  the Elemental Spirits of the Heights, to whom frequent allusion is made,
  must find the winter sports of a later age a sorry substitute for the
  rare old frolics of the fifteenth century.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It can at least be claimed for Mrs. <font class="sc">Margaret Baillie
  Saunders</font> that she has provided an original setting and "chorus"
  for her new novel, <i>Becky &amp; Co</i>. (<font
  class="sc">Hutchinson</font>). Tales of City courtship have been written
  often enough, but the combination here of a millinery establishment and a
  community of Little Sisters of St. Francis under one roof in the
  Minories, gives a stimulating atmosphere to a story otherwise not
  specially distinguished. <i>Becky</i> was, as perhaps you may have
  guessed, head of the millinery business, next door to which was housed
  the firm of <i>Ray, St. Cloud &amp; Stiggany</i>, leather-dressers, the
  three partners in which all presently become suitors for the hand of
  <i>Becky.</i> This in effect is the story&mdash;under which thimble will
  the heart of the heroine be eventually found?&mdash;a problem that, in
  view of the obviously superior claims of young <i>St. Cloud</i> over his
  two elderly rivals, will not leave you long guessing. An element of novel
  complication is however furnished by the device of making <i>St.
  Cloud</i> at first engaged to <i>Ray's</i> daughter, who, subsequently
  retiring into the Franciscan sisterhood, left her <i>fiancé</i> free to
  become the rival of her widowed father. (As the late <font class="sc">Dan
  Leno</font> used to observe, this is a little intricate!) For the rest,
  as I have said, an agreeable, very feminine story of mingled sentiment,
  commerce and ecclesiastical interest, the last predominating.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>It is possible that <i>The Sea Bride</i> (<font class="sc">Mills and
  Boon</font>) may be too violent to suit all tastes, for Mr. <font
  class="sc">Ben Ames Williams</font> writes of men primitive in their
  loves and hates, and he describes them graphically. The scenes of this
  story are set on the whaler <i>Sally</i>, commanded by a man of mighty
  renown in the whaling world. When we meet him he has passed his prime and
  has just taken unto himself a young wife. She goes with him in the
  <i>Sally</i>, and the way in which Mr. <font class="sc">Williams</font>
  shows how her courage increases as her husband's character weakens wins
  my most sincere admiration. His tale would be nothing out of the common
  but for his skill in giving individuality to his characters. Things
  happen on the <i>Sally</i>, bloodthirsty, sinister, terrible things,
  which the author neither glosses nor gloats over, being content to make
  them appear essential to the development of the story. I am going to keep
  my eye on Mr. <font class="sc">Williams</font>, chiefly because he can
  write enthrallingly, but partly to see if he will accept a word of advice
  and be a little more sparing in his use of those little dots ... which
  are the first and last infirmity of writers who have no sense of
  punctuation.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>When a young man sets out to London to make money for his relations he
  usually (in a novel) writes a book which sells prodigiously&mdash;quite
  an easy thing to do in a novel. Mr. John Wilberforce, however, avoids the
  beaten track in <i>The Champion of the Family</i> (<font
  class="sc">Fisher Unwin</font>). <i>Jack Brockhurst</i>, the champion in
  question, became a member of the Stock Exchange, and, if you will accept
  my invitation and follow his fortunes, I can promise you a fluttering
  time. Mr. <font class="sc">Wilberforce's</font> name is unknown to me,
  and I judge him more experienced in the mysteries of the Stock Exchange
  than in the art of fiction; but I like his constructive ability and I
  like his courage. He does not hesitate to make his champion a prig, which
  is exactly what a youth so idolised by his family would be likely to
  become. But, though a prig by training, <i>Jack</i> was not by nature a
  bore, and his relations (especially his father and sister) are delightful
  people. Altogether I find this a most promising performance.</p>

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
